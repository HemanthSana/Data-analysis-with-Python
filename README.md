# Data analysis with Python
## A course for scientists

This is the material for a Python course I taught at NMBU summer 2019.
The first lecture covers basic Python syntax, the second lecture covers Pandas for data analysis and the final lecture covers data visualisation with Matplotlib, Pandas and Seaborn.
